# Simple-Moving-Average-Crossover-Strategy-with-MetaTrader5-Integration
 Automate trading with Python! This script implements a simple moving average crossover strategy using MetaTrader5, executing buy and sell orders based on market signals. Efficient risk management included.
 
## Overview
This Python script implements a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy for automated trading using the MetaTrader5 (MT5) platform. The strategy identifies buy and sell signals based on the crossover of a short-term SMA with a longer-term SMA.

### Strategy Components
- **Signal Generation**: The script calculates the last candle close and SMA values to determine the direction of the market (buy or sell).
- **Order Execution**: Market orders are executed to enter or exit positions based on the generated signals.
- **Trail Stop Loss**: The script includes functionality to dynamically update stop-loss orders to manage risk.

## Strategy Parameters
- `SYMBOL`: The trading symbol (e.g., currency pair) to be traded.
- `VOLUME`: The volume of the trade to be executed.
- `TIMEFRAME`: The timeframe used for analyzing candlestick data.
- `SMA_PERIOD`: The period for the SMA calculation.
- `DEVIATION`: Deviation for market orders.
- `MAX_DIST_SL`: Maximum distance between current price and stop-loss to trigger an update.
- `TRAIL_AMOUNT`: Amount by which the stop-loss updates.
- `DEFAULT_SL`: Default stop-loss value if none is set.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- MetaTrader5 Terminal installed and running
- Necessary Python packages: `MetaTrader5`, `pandas`

## Usage
1. **Configuration**: Replace the placeholders in the script with your desired parameters.
2. **MetaTrader5 Setup**: Ensure the MetaTrader5 Terminal is running and connected.
3. **Execution**: Run the script to start the automated trading strategy.
